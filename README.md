# JSLibraryForMatrix
Thats a simple javascipt library for every matrix with numbers. Matrix will be automatically reformed for further and easier manipulation of numbers.
Clicking on the title of each column, the selected column will be sorted.
There are two buttons added at the right of each row. With the first one you can copy each row and with the second one you can delete it.
There are also certain math functions to calculate for each column through selects:

Min
Max
Mean
Mode
Median
Range
Variance
StdDev (Standard Deviation)

Every change of a number will automatically update functions result.
